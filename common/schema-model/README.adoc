= SmallRye GraphQL Schema Model

This is a representation of a GraphQL Schema. It gets build using Jandex scanning and passed into the implementation to create an executable endpoint.

== Schema

A Schema contains:

- a set of query operations
- a set of mutation operations
- a map of interface types, mapped by classname
- a map of types, mapped by classname
- a map of input types, mapped by classname
- a map of enum types, mapped by classname

=== Reference

During scanning certain object reference other objects that might not have been scanned yet, 
so we always just have reference to that (potentially future) object.

A Reference contains:

- the classname
- the graphql name
- the reference type
- a classname, into which the referenced class can be converted, which is understood by graphql. Used for transformations.

=== Reference Type

Enum that indicate the type of object. Valid options are:

- INPUT
- TYPE
- INTERFACE
- ENUM
- SCALAR

=== EnumType

A basic entry in the schema that represent an enum. It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description
- list of valid values

=== Input Type

A complex entry in the schema that represents a Input. It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description
- set of fields on the input.

=== Interface

A complex entry in the schema that represents a Interface. It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description
- set of fields on the type.
- set of interfaces that this type implements.

=== Type

A complex entry in the schema that represents a Type. It contains:

- all fields from Reference
- a description
- set of fields on the type.
- set of interfaces that this interface implements.

=== Field

Represents a field in a Type/Input/Interface. It contains:

- the Java method name
- the Java property name (typically same as method without get/set)
- the GraphQL name
- a optional description
- a reference to the type
- a notNull flag
- an optional array, that contains information about the array
- an optional format, that contains information about transformation
- an optional default value

=== Operation
A special kind of field, that can also take arguments on the field. 
It's used by Queries, Mutations and Source fields. It contains:

- everything from Field
- a Java Class Name (where this operation method is on)
- a list of arguments
- a reference to the containing type
- an async flag, when the operation returns a `CompletionStage`

=== Argument

A special kind of field that is use as input. It contains:

- everything from Field
- the java method parameter name
- an indication if this argument is a Source argument
