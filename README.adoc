= SmallRye GraphQL

SmallRye GraphQL is an implementation of 

- {microprofile-graphql}[Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL].
- {graphql-over-http}[GraphQL over HTTP].
- {graphql-ws}[GraphQL over WebSocket].
- {subscriptions-transport-ws}[Subscriptions transport ws] (old).
- {graphql-federation}[GraphQL Federation]

== Instructions

=== Testing against the released v 2.0 of MicroProfile GraphQL

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

Note that some tests perform locale-sensitive assertions.
If you use non-English locale, you need to adjust the command above.
For example: `LANG=C mvn clean install`

=== Testing against the unreleased v 2.1-SNAPSHOT of MicroProfile GraphQL

(You need to build that version of MicroProfile GraphQL locally first to make the snapshot versions available in your repository)

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Dversion.eclipse.microprofile.graphql=2.1-SNAPSHOT
----

=== Documentation

The live documentation is available at link:https://smallrye.io/smallrye-graphql[this link].

Info about how to build and manage the documentation is in `docs/README.adoc`.

=== Javax/Jakarta

The 1.5.x branch will be maintained for the `javax` namespace, and the main (2.x) branch for `jakarta`.

=== Project structure

==== Common

* link:common/schema-model[Schema Model] (Serializable) that defines the schema.
* link:common/schema-builder[Schema Builder] that create the model from Jandex.

==== Server

* link:server/api[API] (pulling in the MicroProfile API) and allowing us to experiment with api feature not yet in the spec. Code from here might move the the spec at some point.
* link:server/implementation[Implementation] of the Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL API.
* link:server/implementation-cdi[CDI] Module that allows lookup of GraphQL Endpoints via CDI
* link:server/implementation-servlet[Servlet] Making the implementation available via Servlet
* link:server/tck[TCK] Test suite to run the implementation against the {microprofile-graphql}[Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL] TCK.
* link:server/runner[Runner] Manual TCK testing with GraphiQL
* link:server/integration-tests[IT] To run some Integration tests

==== Client

* link:client/api[Client API] (pulling in the MicroProfile Client API) and allowing us to experiment with api feature not yet in the spec. Code from here might move the the spec at some point.
* link:client/implementation[Client Implementation] of the Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL Client API.
* link:client/tck[Client TCK] Test suite to run the client-implementation against the {microprofile-graphql}[Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL] Client TCK.

==== Tools

* link:tools/maven-plugin[Maven plugin] that generates the GraphQL schema from source files.
* link:tools/gradle-plugin[Gradle plugin] that generates the GraphQL schema from source files.

==== UI

* link:ui/graphiql[GraphiQL] UI for your project
