* link:server/integration-tests[IT] To run some Integration tests

==== Client

* link:client/api[Client API] (pulling in the MicroProfile Client API) and allowing us to experiment with api feature not yet in the spec. Code from here might move the the spec at some point.
* link:client/implementation[Client Implementation] of the Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL Client API.
* link:client/tck[Client TCK] Test suite to run the client-implementation against the {microprofile-graphql}[Eclipse MicroProfile GraphQL] Client TCK.
