Configuration properties
========================

These are properties understood directly by SmallRye GraphQL. If you're using SmallRye GraphQL through
Quarkus, these will generally work, but Quarkus offers its own counterparts for most of these, 
and it is recommended to use the `quarkus.*` properties. Refer to the Quarkus documentation: 
[Server](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-smallrye-graphql_quarkus-smallrye-graphql-smallrye-graphql) and
[Client](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config#quarkus-smallrye-graphql-client_quarkus-smallrye-graphql-client-smallrye-graphql-client)
side Quarkus properties.
